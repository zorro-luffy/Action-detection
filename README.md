Introduction
This project aims to detect and recognize sign language gestures using a combination of MediaPipe Holistic for hand tracking and pose estimation, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence modeling. Sign language detection is crucial for enabling communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need:

Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
MediaPipe
NumPy

Make sure to have a webcam or a video feed as input for real-time sign language detection.

Usage
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of sign language gestures. Ensure that each gesture is annotated with corresponding labels.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by extracting hand and pose landmarks using MediaPipe Holistic. Convert the data into sequences suitable for LSTM input, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data. Tune hyperparameters such as sequence length, number of LSTM units, learning rate, etc., for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used for evaluation.

Inference: Deploy the trained model for real-time sign language detection. Use MediaPipe Holistic to extract hand and pose landmarks from webcam or video feed, preprocess the data, and feed it into the LSTM model for prediction.
